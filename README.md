## Task Manager

Task Management app built in React js, https://my-motivator-db.firebaseapp.com/

### `the features this app has`

I am pretty confident to say that this app is probably the best todo app ever on the internet.
You can pretty much do anything related to task management.
I categorized tasks by date, hour, month, week, type, importance, completion and so on.
Also, There is history page where you can see the rate of your completion in diverse categories as well.
Plus, It has really beautiful UI which is simple to use

I am thinking of adding more features to make this app by far the best todo app ever.

### `tools and libraries I used`

I used react-saga, material ui and a little bit of styled-library to style,
firebase, date-fns and so on.

### `Things I learned`

Material Ui Library has a quite deep learning curve but is really flexible and easy to customize. I could customize it as much as I want.

### `Challenge I faced`

It is feasible to deal with date value without using a library like date-fns but can be a nightmare.
So I used date-fns, which made development so much easier.

Creating our own graph or chart can be quite tricky. Thus, I picked up a small React Chart library called recharts and made my life so much easier.

Since there's nothing to do for unauthenticated user on this app, I decided to force user to sign 1n
before entering to the start page

### `Q & A`

### `can I copy your app?`

Yes! , I'd be glad to help.
However, you are required to mention my name Shawn and that you copied my work on your app, if you
replicate almost everyting on my app.
